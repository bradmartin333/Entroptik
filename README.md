# Entroptik
This application calculates the statistical entropy of a cropped image's ARGB values.
The scores are compared to a user-defined training score and tolerance to generate a binary output log.
The end result is a log describing the presence or absence of features among all photos in a directory.
Because this application does not use any ML and is in fact "dumb", the photo aligment must be repeatable.
