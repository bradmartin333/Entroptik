If running a new batch of images with the same setup,
copy the matching *.ew file and open the new directory
of images to save it to the *.ew file path.


For faster runtimes, use ImageMagick to crop and resize batches of images.
Download and install the appropriate version from the software's website.
Also, downloading and installing the appropriate version of IrfanView will be helpful.



In IrfanView, holding down the left mouse button shows the XY coordinated of the cursor.
Also, clicking and dragging show width and height values.
All that information is displayed in the window heading.



For cropping:

1) Open the command line in the directory of the source images.

		This can be done easily by opening the directory in file explorer
		then de-selecting from the present files and Shift + Right clicking in
		empty space in the file explorer and clicking "Open PowerShell window here"

2) Copy and paste this template into the PowerShell window and modify as needed

		magick mogrify -crop 300x300+150+150 *.png

		where 300x300 is the width and height of the output images
		and +150+150 is how far in from the top left corner to offset

		*.png is the image file extension to look for



For resizing:

Very similar to cropping, but use this template instead:

	magick mogrify -resize 960x528 *.png



It is also possible to output to a different directory by specifying a -path in the command.
ImageMagick is a great tool and there is a lot of documentation online.
